Thanks for installing the Sublime Text package for GDL!


How to use
===============

From now you can just select `GDL` from the code-language menu in the bottom right corner of Sublime Text.
BUT wait! There's more!

Activate the color scheme
-------------------------

Activate color scheme by modifying a syntax specific preferences file, which you can find using the menu item `Preferences -> Settings - More -> Syntax Specific â€“ User`.

Copy this into the new file and save:

{
	"color_scheme": "Packages/GDL/GDL.tmTheme"
}


GDL color scheme
----------------

This color scheme is especially made for a comfortable working GDL coding environment in Sublime Text.
