GDL Sublime Text package
has successfully updated

*************************

ＶＥＲＳＩＯＮ 		3.3.0

*************************

CHANGELOG:

# changed
• Global params (green) now get recognized when used as an array.
• Params weren't recognized when used in an array.
• The way GDL-S looks for HSF and GSMs is greatly improved.

# added
• New project settings: With `convert_on_save` set to true a GSM will automatically be built if you edited and saved a GDL file.
• Backticks (`) get auto matched now, if the respective ST setting is enabled by the user.
• Snippets for the parameter list in `libpartdata.xml` were added. [^1]

# fixed
• In certain circumstances the GSM Build command could fail.
• If the user had file extensions being ALLCAPS the conversion failed.

# removed
• Multiroot environments are error prone and support (which was instable before already) for it has been removed. It might return at a later point however.
