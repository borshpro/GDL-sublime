Thanks for installing the GDL Sublime Text package!


What's new ???
===============

• UI_NEXT and UI_PREV are now onboard
• colors changed slightly
• also functions in functions are styled correctly now


How to use
===============

From now you can just select `GDL` from the code-language menu in the bottom right corner of Sublime Text.
BUT wait! There's more!

Activate the color scheme
-------------------------

Activate color scheme by modifying a syntax specific preferences file, which you can find using the menu item `Preferences -> Settings - More -> Syntax Specific – User`.

Copy this into the new file and save:

{
	"color_scheme": "Packages/GDL/GDL.tmTheme"
}


GDL color scheme
----------------

This color scheme is made especially for a comfortable GDL coding environment in Sublime Text.  
If you like it: I have also a more complete color scheme aligned with a beatiful and minimal UI theme.
You can find it here:	https://github.com/runxel/hitoshi
Give it a try!
