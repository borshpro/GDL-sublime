Thanks for installing the Sublime Text package for GDL!


What's new ???
===============

• we have auto completion now
[you may have to force it with `ctrl + space`!]

• we have snippets!
[they are in the "Snippets" folder, just make your own aswell, or edit them :)]



How to use
===============

From now you can just select `GDL` from the code-language menu in the bottom right corner of Sublime Text.
BUT wait! There's more!

Activate the color scheme
-------------------------

Activate color scheme by modifying a syntax specific preferences file, which you can find using the menu item `Preferences -> Settings - More -> Syntax Specific – User`.

Copy this into the new file and save:

{
	"color_scheme": "Packages/GDL/GDL.tmTheme"
}


GDL color scheme
----------------

This color scheme is especially made for a comfortable working GDL coding environment in Sublime Text.  
If you like it: I have a also a more complete color scheme aligned with a beatiful an minimal UI theme.
