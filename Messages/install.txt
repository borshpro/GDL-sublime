*************************
Thanks for installing the
GDL Sublime Text package!
*************************


       How to use
=========================

From now you can just select `GDL` from the code-language menu in the bottom right corner of Sublime Text.
BUT wait! There's more!

Activate the color scheme
-------------------------

Activate the color scheme by modifying a syntax specific preferences file, which you can find using the menu item `Preferences -> Settings - More -> Syntax Specific â€“ User`.

There a 2 different color schemes at choice: A dark and light one. _I muchly recommend the dark one for fatigue-proof coding!_

Copy _one_ of these into the new file and save:

Dark:
{  
	"color_scheme": "Packages/GDL/GDL-dark.tmTheme"  
}

Light:
{  
	"color_scheme": "Packages/GDL/GDL-light.tmTheme"  
}

GDL color scheme
----------------

This color scheme is made especially for a comfortable GDL coding environment in Sublime Text.  
If you like it: I have also a more complete color scheme aligned with a beatiful and minimal UI theme.
You can find it here:	https://github.com/runxel/hitoshi
Give it a try!
